                    Procrastination is taken for granted and many students don't get the help they need to stop procrastinating. 
                    I understand what it feels like to be the Queen/King of procrastination. 
                    Many people call me "Your Highness" when they hear the word procrasination.
                    I won't be able to cure procrastination, but I will try to supress the side effects of late work, bad grades, and sleepless nights.
